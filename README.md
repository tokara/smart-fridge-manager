## 👨‍💻 About
Built as part of my frontend development re-learning journey.
With this app, we are actually skiipping pure HTM/CSS and diving striaght into Next.js + React. JSX is utilized here (basically, Javascript that looks like HTML...interesting!!). 
Tailwind CSS is also employed here as part of the learning process. (Tailwind-->utility classes instead of separate CSS files).
This app demonstrates React hooks, TypeScript interfaces, component 
architecture, accessibility best practices and Next.js App Router.




































---------------------Default notes-----

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
